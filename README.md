This is a assignment on Transliteration given a input word in some language translate it into word of another language which sounds same.
Chosen 2 languages are <b>English</b> and <b>Hindi</b>  

<h3> Encoder Decoder Model </h3>
In this assignment i used various Encoder Decoder Model to handle the task of transliteration.
Various Encoder Decoder Model used in this assignment are:
<ul>
  <li> RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) </li>
   <li> LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) </li>
   <li> GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit </li>
  </ul>
  A simple encoder consist of input layer (with or without word embedding) a hidden layer(recursively connected to one another) and a output layer(not used in this task) and decoder consist of the same components.
